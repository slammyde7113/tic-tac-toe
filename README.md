Project History:

  The first step of this project started with a planning phase. Planning was incorporate with the utilization of a wire-frame scketch. The wire-frame used in project is linked below:

  The project was broken up into the following steps:
  1.) API Set-up
  2.) Game Logic Implementation
  3.) Webpage Styling

  API set-up was by far the most difficult part of the project, as it was still a new concept for me to wrap my mind around. Writing curl scripts alleviated the difficulty, however, navigating the potential outputs for the API calls was almost like looking into a black box. At first, I was bashing in commands without any idea of what to expect. After a day or so of playing around with the API inputs and outputs I started to understand why certain result would occur. Once I got a firm grasp of what was happening on the backend of my project, I was able to start working on the game logic.

  Setting up the game logic of the tic-tac-toe board was the most enjoyable part of this process. Solving logic problems and finding multiple solutions to complex problems kept my brain firing on all cylinders. It was a nice break from working on the API because all the logic code was right in front me, which gave me huge advantage when debugging. Once the game logic was fully functional, CSS became my next hurdle.

  I'd like to start off by saying I am not an artistic man, and I think my webpage set up is a clear representation of that fact. I kept my design simplistic, as functionality was my main goal for this project. I added features that made the application more user-friendly, but in the end, I focused on an understandable game with little distractions.
